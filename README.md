**Project Title:** Solo Rage Cage 

**Description:** This project reimagines the popular drinking game Rage Cage as a single-player interactive experience. The player begins by pressing the joystick to start, aims using the joystick, adjusts the power with the potentiometer, and shoots with the button. All components are housed within 3D-printed enclosures.

**Components Needed:** Lily TTGO esp32, joystick, potentiometer, buttom, cable
