Description:

Bottom Box: Box for the button and the potentiometer. 
When I printed this design, the holes were too small for the M3 screws and components. 
I adjusted the design, but please note that their dimensions might need further tuning.

Assembly: Diagram of the smaller boxes inside the larger box, showing alignment.
The assembly uses Prof Tseng's joystick design.
